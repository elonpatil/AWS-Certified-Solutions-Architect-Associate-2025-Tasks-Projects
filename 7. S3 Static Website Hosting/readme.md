**AWS S3 Static Website Hosting**

In this hands-on project, I set up an S3 Static Website using AWS S3. The goal was to host a simple static website using an S3 bucket with public access and proper security policies.

1. Created an S3 Bucket and Enabled public access for website access.
2. Generated S3 Bucket Policy.
3. Uploaded Static Website Files.
4. Enabled Static Website Hosting in the S3 bucket and Deployed the Website.

Please find the Screenshots as below. 

1.	Create the S3 bucket with all public access allowed.
