**AWS Elastic Beanstalk**

I explored AWS Elastic Beanstalk as part of my AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate preparation. This hands-on exercise involved:

1. Creating an elastic BeanStalk environment
2. Setting up an EC2 instance role to allow Beanstalk to manage resources
3. Deploying a Node.js application on Beanstalk

1.	Create the webserver environment.
