**AWS S3 Lifecycle Management Project**

In this hands-on project, I worked with Amazon S3 to create and manage storage efficiently. I provisioned S3 buckets and implemented lifecycle rules to optimize cost and data retention. The lifecycle policies included transitioning objects to different storage classes based on access patterns and automated deletion of obsolete data. This project demonstrates practical knowledge of S3 storage management and cost optimization strategies.

1.	Created the bucket with versioning enabled.

2.	Created the lifecycle rule for bucket.

3.	Transition current versions of objects between storage classes.

5.	Expire current versions of objects.

6.	Permanently delete noncurrent versions of objects.

7.	S3 lifecycle rule is generated. According to the rules set, the objects will be moved to the different storage classes OR to be deleted.
